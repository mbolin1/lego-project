The CIO of The Lego Corporation has hired you and your web development crew to design a stylish new website for one of the Lego themes. As with historical Lego precedent, they're going to give you free reign to design and implement the site; they have so much faith in your abilities they're willing to let you choose your own theme.
Spec:

    Create a website showcasing the awesomeness of one of the Lego themes (Links to an external site.)
    There should be at least 4 interconnected web pages:
        Homepage (index.html)
            basic page, sets standard for the rest of the pages to follow
            at least one image representing your chosen Lego theme
            the name and slogan of the club
        About the theme (about.html)
            some information about the Lego theme (years , founding)
            what the theme is about
            table comparing the value of your selected theme against at least three other themes
        Sell some Legos (order.html)
            a page holding a form for visitors to order Legos from your set
            must require a user to order with a valid
                first name/last name
                address (city/state/zip)
                e-mail
                date of birth
                Credit card number
                requested lego
                    needs to be a select box of a few Legos offered
                    selecting a Lego will bring up price, an image, and a description
        Sitemap (sitemap.html)
            a simple page listing all of the websites pages that can be reached
    Each page should use one general style sheet (lego-general.css) that applies a thematic flow to the pages
        i.e. If I choose to create a site for Naruto Legos, my lego-general.css would apply to all of my pages:
            an orangish background
            excited small caps font
            yellow font for exciting headings
            maybe some cool blue windswept rasengan-y :hover for my links
            obviously, you won't be able to use Naruto legos, as they do not exist
        the lego-general.css will be linked by every page, give it broad enough rules that will be used everywhere
        pages may have individual stylesheets (i.e. lego-about.css), but no in-line style attributes

Expectations:

    work in groups of up to 3 people
    html pages will be html5 compliant (tested here (Links to an external site.))
    css pages will be css3 compliant (tested here (Links to an external site.))
    all source code will show proper/consistent formatting
    no erroneous red code in firefox html preview
    web site will be hosted on people.emich

Deliverables:

    Final Project:
        Print out of all source code due 7:20pm on the 10th
        Demo/walkthrough in class
        Individual writeup of the responsibilities for the group members
